## Projects: An Educational Trip in Data Engineering

This repository showcases my journey into Data Engineering. Here, you'll find projects I've completed to explore various tools and techniques, from data wrangling and pipeline creation to building predictive models.

### Project Structure

Each project has its own dedicated directory. Inside you might find:

* **README.md:** A project overview, outlining goals and the technologies used.
* **data:** Raw data utilized in the project (if applicable).
* **scripts:** Scripts for data processing, transformation, and analysis (e.g., Python with pandas, Spark).
* **notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration and analysis (optional).
* **models:** Trained predictive models and their evaluation metrics (optional).
* **output:** The resulting data products, visualizations, or reports (optional).

### Technologies Explored

This repository delves into various data engineering tools and techniques, including:

* **Databases:**
    * Relational: Oracle RDBMS, MS SQL, MySQL
    * NoSQL: Redis, MongoDB, Cassandra
* **Development:**
    * Java (Maven, Spring Boot)
    * JavaScript (Node.js, Flask)
* **Data Processing & Analytics:**
    * Python (Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Dask)
    * Apache Spark & PySpark
* **Data Warehousing & Messaging:**
    * Parquet, Feather file formats
    * Apache Kafka, Mosquitto
* **Streaming & IoT:**
    * Debezium
    * Apache NiFi
    * ThingsBoard
* **Cloud & Orchestration:**
    * AWS Cloud Services
