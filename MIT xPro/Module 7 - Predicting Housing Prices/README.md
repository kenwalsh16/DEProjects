## Module 7: Predicting Housing Prices with Improved Linear Regression

This folder contains the project files and documentation for predicting housing prices using linear regression, completed for Module 7 of the MIT xPRO Professional Certificate in Data Engineering. 

**Project Description**

This project delves into data analysis techniques and linear regression to build a model for predicting real estate housing prices. It goes beyond the initial examples presented in Videos 7.9 and 7.10 by exploring a wider range of variables and aiming for improved results.

**Project Goals**

* Enhance the housing price prediction model from Videos 7.9 and 7.10 by incorporating additional variables.
* Analyze at least six variables in total within the data frame for model creation.
* Explore various approaches to improve upon the results achieved in the reference videos.

**Project Files**

* `houseSmallData.csv`: Training data for the model in CSV format.
* `jtest.csv`: Final test data in CSV format.
* `house_predictor.py`: Python code for data processing, model training, and prediction.
* `Module_7_Housing_Prices.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for interactive data exploration, visualization, and model development.
* `Module_7_Presentation.pptx`: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the project findings.

**Project Outline**

This project follows the recommended structure outlined in the provided template. Ensure you have thoroughly reviewed the template and possess a clear understanding of:

* Necessary steps for building the desired model.
* Effective techniques for model creation and result interpretation.

**Presentation Considerations**

* **Minimal Text:** Utilize bullet points for concise and clear presentation of information.
* **Data Visualization:** Include screenshots of significant plots and visualizations to enhance clarity.
* **Target Audience:** Tailor the presentation for a non-technical audience, focusing on visuals and key results. Exclude code snippets from the presentation.

**Deliverables**

This project submission comprises:

* Jupyter Notebook
* Python Script (`house_predictor.py`)
* PowerPoint Presentation (`Module_7_Presentation.pptx`)
